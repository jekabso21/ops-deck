Perfect â€” let's finalize all the **project boilerplate and small essentials** before jumping into full code scaffolding.

Here's what we'll include in this final sweep:

---

## âœ… Finalized Project Boilerplate

### 1. `README.md`

An MVP-ready, public-facing README for the `ops-deck` monorepo.

### 2. `LICENSE`

MIT license â€” widely used, permissive.

### 3. `.gitignore`

Ignore common build, env, and node-specific files.

### 4. `.editorconfig` (optional but helpful)

Standardizes code style across editors.

### 5. `CONTRIBUTING.md` (early placeholder)

Explains contribution expectations (will evolve later).

# OpsDeck

> A modern, self-hosted operations platform for internal tooling â€” built with Next.js, NestJS, and PostgreSQL.

---

## ðŸš§ Status

This project is currently in early active MVP development.

It is intended as a **modular open-source base** that can later be extended into a full SaaS platform with self-hosted and cloud deployment options.
